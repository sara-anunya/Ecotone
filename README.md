# Urban Ecotone: Our Site as a Point Cloud Interface

## Project Overview

Urban Ecotone is an experimental spatial interface that represents our studio site as a navigable point cloud environment. Rather than presenting the site as a fixed object or static map, the project invites users to experience the site through shifting human and more-than-human perspectives.

The interface is a continuation of Anunya and Sara's initial projects, where movement of cursor dictates perception, and agency.

## Concept

An ecotone is a transitional zone between two ecological conditions. In this project, the urban ecotone is understood not only as a physical boundary, but as a perceptual one where scales, bodies, and modes of inhabitation overlap.

An ecotone is also where multiple species meet and co-exist, thus the site can be experienced through the perspective of a mouse and a barn owl.

The point cloud abstracts the site into fragments of data, allowing users to move fluidly between perspectives that are not fixed to a single human viewpoint. Navigation becomes an act of interpretation, suggesting how different entities, humans and more than humans, might experience the same space differently.

## Interface & Navigation

The website uses mouse and keyboard inputs as the primary mode of engagement. These inputs are intentionally foregrounded to make navigation feel active and embodied.

### Controls

* **Mouse movement** — Controls the direction of view
* **Scroll wheel** — Zooms in and out of the point cloud
* **W / A / S / D keys** — Move forward, left, backward, and right through the site
* **Click + drag** — Rotate and explore spatial depth
* **Space** — Pauses the flight of the owl

The act of navigating through the point cloud mirrors movement through the site itself, partial, unstable, and continuously shifting.

## Representation Strategy

* The point cloud captures the site as a field of data rather than a solid form
* Density, visibility, and depth change as the user moves, revealing different spatial readings
* The absence of solid geometry allows the site to be read as atmospheric, ecological, and temporal

This representation resists a single authoritative view and instead supports multiple simultaneous interpretations.

## Technical Framework

* Built using javascript
* Rendered in-browser using WebGL
* Designed for desktop interaction (mouse and keyboard)
